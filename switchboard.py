##SwitchBoard framework:
    ####PubSub triggers GCF endpoints.
    ####Trigger endpoints will trigger SwitchBoard GCF via HTTP.
    ####SwitchBoard contains graph data structure that will trigger appropriate pipelines via HTTP.
        ###SwitchBoard will reference .json file in cloud storage for any additional dependencies that should be considered.
        ###When a pipeline is triggered a 200 response is returned immediately to identify a successful trigger.
        ###Any failures will exist in logs of pipeline GCF.
    ####On completion of pipeline GCF, SwitchBoard will be triggered to communicate successful run.
        ###SwitchBoard will update .json file in cloud storage once successful pipeline run is communicated to it.

    # need to setup SwitchBoard library
        ## git+https://github.com/osteensco/[SwitchBoard].git
        ## pip install -e
            ## this will install the library in "editable mode" allowing changes to the library to be reflected automatically
